## Joint Modeling Example Code ##

The code in `Example_JointModeling_Code.R` fits a joint model for longitudinal and survival data using the Monte Carlo ECM (MC-ECM) algorithm. 

Details of the type of model and algorithm being used can be found in:

The file `Example_JointModeling_Code.R` is entirely self-contained and can be run via `source('Example_JointModeling_Code.R')` (from the appropriate working directory). The file loads in the data from `Aids.RData`, and will output a file `Results.RData` containing the results of the fit.

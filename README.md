TestCases
=========

Some examples of regular old R code as used in various statistical applications. 

+ JointModeling: Contains code to fit a joint model for survival and longitudinal data using the ECM algorithm.
+ BayesLogit: Contains code to fit a Bayesian Logistic Regression model using either a vanilla MH or Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm.
+ logNlogS: Contains code to fit a Broken-Pareto model to populations of astrophysical sources using the Interwoven EM algorithm.

See the README files in each directory for further details.
